Hi,

I'm an IT and DevOps Engineer hoping to transition into the exciting world of AI/ML. While I'm relatively new to this field, I'm incredibly curious and have recently completed an AI/ML Developer program capped with a log classification project using RandomForestClassifier, gaining practical experience in data preprocessing, model development, and deployment.

My background includes roles at IBM Singapore, Starhub, NCS Pte Ltd and NETS Pte Ltd, where I've built a strong foundation in both on-premise & cloud technologies (AWS, Linux), automation, and development. I'm proficient in Python, machine learning libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras), and AWS, with a good  grasp of DevOps principles.

I believe in learning by doing and am eager to apply my existing skills to AI/ML projects. I'm more focused on contributing and growing than farming for certifications, though I do have a few relevant ones (like in AI/ML development and Python). My log classification project demonstrates my ability to work through the AI/ML workflow, from data wrangling to model deployment.

I'm a humble and dedicated learner, excited about the potential of AI/ML and looking for an opportunity to contribute to an innovative team. I enjoy problem-solving and am always open to new challenges. Well, you might find my github repos seemingly bare. Partly that's because I made the switch from bitbucket.org last year, and they are mostly private. Let me know if you are curious. 

Outside of tech, I practice Aikido, jog, and travel for photography.

If you're open to explore how I may be fit or able to contribute to your organization's AI journey, I'd love to connect!
